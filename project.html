<h2>Class Attendance Management Using Face Recognition | February 2023 - May 2023</h2>
   <p> -	In this project we can able to collect data from the camera, capturing multiple images of their face to create a dataset. we can detect faces in real-time. The classifier will identify the location of the face in the image. After collecting the images, we can train the recognizer by using the LBPH algorithm to train the recognizer on the images this will create a face recognition model that can be used to recognize faces. The system use the extracted features to train a model for face recognition. This model recognize faces in real-time by comparing them with the stored data in the dataset. Once a face is detected, by using the recognizer we can recognize the person. If the person is recognized, we mark their attendance in database. Here we used Tkinter to create a graphical user interface (GUI) to enter student details , to train data and for the face recognizer to mark attendance. Here we used Flask,HTML,CSS,JS to develop the user interface for viewing and downloading the attendance.</p>
